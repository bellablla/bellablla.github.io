An Arduino program called hello-lastname1.ino (where lastname1 is your Kenyon email username).
The first line of code should be: // (c) YYYY lastname1 : where 'lastname1' is your Kenyon username and YYYY is the current year.
The second line of code should be a comment that describes what this program is (not just 'modular hello world').
The rest of the code should follow the constraints:

Uses a variable, count, that keeps track of the number of times that the loop() function runs
Each time through the loop, another variable, isSixtiethTime, should be updated (using modular arithmetic we've learned) to be 0 if this is a multiple of 60 times through the loop (i.e., it should be set to 0 when count is 60, 120, 180, etc.). If count is not yet a multiple of 60 times through the loop, any number other than 0 can be stored in it (like, say, 1, 2, 3...59).
